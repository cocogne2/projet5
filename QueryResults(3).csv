<p>The environment I need is relatively simple, just for going through some tutorials. As an example, this <a href=""https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/golang/tutorial/"" rel=""noreferrer"">operator-sdk guide</a>.</p>
<p>So far I've tried <code>microk8s</code> and <code>minikube</code>, as they're tools I've used before on other machines.</p>
<p>For both of these, I've installed them using <code>brew</code> after opening the terminal app &quot;with Rosetta 2&quot;
(i.e like <a href=""https://doesitarm.com/app/homebrew/benchmarks/#rU-fa0sbCGs"" rel=""noreferrer"">this</a>). My progress is then:</p>
<p><strong>Minikube</strong></p>
<p>When I run <code>minikube start --driver=docker</code> (having installed the <a href=""https://www.docker.com/blog/download-and-try-the-tech-preview-of-docker-desktop-for-m1/"" rel=""noreferrer"">tech preview of Docker Desktop for M1</a>), an initialization error occurs. It seems to me that this is being tracked here <a href=""https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/9224"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/9224</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Microk8s</strong></p>
<p><code>microk8s install</code> asks to install <code>multipass</code>, which then errors with <code>An error occurred with the instance when trying to start with 'multipass': returned exit code 2. Ensure that 'multipass' is setup correctly and try again.</code>. Multipass shows a <code>microk8s-vm</code> stuck in starting. I think this may relate to this issue <a href=""https://github.com/canonical/multipass/issues/1857"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://github.com/canonical/multipass/issues/1857</a>.</p>
<p>I'm aware I'd probably be better chasing up those issues for help on these particular errors. What would be great is any general advice on if it's currently possible/advisable to setup a basic Kubernetes env for playing with on an M1 mac. I'm not experienced with the underlying technologies here, so any additional context is welcome. :)</p>
<p>If anyone has suggestions for practising Kubernetes, alternative to setting up a local cluster, I'd also appreciate them. Thanks!</p>

<p>We're using <code>npm ci</code> instead of <code>npm install</code> to ensure a clean slate during deployment. However, when we run it without any flags, we get the following error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry this command with --force, or --legacy-peer-deps to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em><strong><a href=""https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-install"" rel=""noreferrer"">documentation</a></strong></em> for <code>npm install</code> for <code>--force</code> is as follows (there are no flags on <code>npm ci</code>'s <em><strong><a href=""https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-ci"" rel=""noreferrer"">page</a></strong></em>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The -f or --force argument will force npm to fetch remote resources even if a local copy exists on disk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, the documentation for <code>--legacy-peer-deps</code> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>--legacy-peer-deps: ignore all peerDependencies when installing, in the style of npm version 4 through version 6.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems that both flags will let <code>npm ci</code> generate the <code>node_modules</code> directory without any issues, but I am still unclear about the differences between the two.</p>
<p>From what I understand, <code>--force</code> sounds like it will be on a last-dependency-downloaded-wins basis and will overwrite any previously downloaded dependencies. Meanwhile, <code>--legacy-peer-deps</code> sounds like it will always skip peer dependencies (whatever those are) during installation even if there are no issues.</p>
<p>What are the differences between the two flags, and when should we use them?</p>

<p>We use appcenter.ms to test iOS apps. Until our iOS certificate expired this method worked fine. We generated a new enterprise certificate and ad hoc provisioning profile for new releases of the iOS app. Which led to the first curiosity.</p>
<p>I see how to upload a certificate on appcenter.ms but not a provisioning profile. I thought there was an option to do this in the past but perhaps I am mistaken. However, the app is signed with a provisioning profile before upload, so perhaps this is not needed now.</p>
<p>Once the app is uploaded, it can't be installed. It remains grey and when you tap it, you get the &quot;this app cannot be installed because its integrity could not be verified&quot; error. Again, that the .ipa is created with an ad hoc certificate and profile in Xamarin (VS for Mac).</p>
<p>Also, I can't install the provisioning profile on a device from appcenter.ms. You basically get stuck in a loop where you seem to successfully install the profile but have to keep doing it because it never actually installs.</p>
<p>I hope this is enough info for some insight and thanks in advance for any feedback.</p>

<p>Why is this? Is this a known issue with Python? How do I fix this?</p>
<p>BTW, CentOS 7 is a given, we cannot upgrade to CentOS 8 at this point. Also, we are using Ansible so using virtualenv I think for target nodes is recommended against by the Ansible community.</p>
<p>We can install Python 3 of course on target nodes but not all Ansible code is available for combination Python 3 with CentOS 7.</p>
<p>Can we use Pip 20?  We would like to upgrade to the most recent version of Pip that still works and I think that is Pip 20. How do I prevent upgrade to Pip 21?</p>

<p>Even though i actually had the header <code>&quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&quot;: &quot;*&quot;</code> which most other answers recommended, the Chrome console printed same error message. Weird thing is that the same code made successful request in mobileApp version. So I think this is only problem with flutter WEB VERSION.</p>
<p>Hope somebody can figure it out and suggest only-dart code to resolve the issue in my main.dart!! Thank you for reading [:</p>

<p>So, <strong>what has changed in the architecture of CPU</strong> (so that it is not an order of magnitude slower anymore)?</p>
<p>Here are results from multiple runs:</p>
<pre><code>Unsorted: 0.543557 0.551147 0.541722 0.555599
Sorted:   0.542587 0.559719 0.53938  0.557909
</code></pre>
<p>Just in case, here is my main.cpp:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;ctime&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
    // Generate data
    const unsigned arraySize = 32768;
    int data[arraySize];

    for (unsigned c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
        data[c] = std::rand() % 256;

    // !!! With this, the next loop runs faster.
    // std::sort(data, data + arraySize);

    // Test
    clock_t start = clock();
    long long sum = 0;

    for (unsigned i = 0; i &lt; 100000; ++i)
    {
        // Primary loop
        for (unsigned c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
        {
            if (data[c] &gt;= 128)
                sum += data[c];
        }
    }

    double elapsedTime = static_cast&lt;double&gt;(clock() - start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;

    std::cout &lt;&lt; elapsedTime &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;sum = &quot; &lt;&lt; sum &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Update</strong></p>
<p>With larger number of elements (627680):</p>
<pre><code>Unsorted
cat main.cpp | grep &quot;std::sort&quot; &amp;&amp; clang++ -O3 main.cpp &amp;&amp; ./a.out
    // std::sort(data, data + arraySize);
10.3814

Sorted:

    std::sort(data, data + arraySize);
10.6885

<hr />
<h2>Some Context</h2>
<p>Creating a new <strong>Flutter</strong> project i found the following (and very familiar) piece code</p>
<pre class=""lang-dart prettyprint-override""><code>int _counter = 0;

void _incrementCounter() {
  setState(() {
    // This call to setState tells the Flutter framework that something has
    // changed in this State, which causes it to rerun the build method below
    // so that the display can reflect the updated values. If we changed
    // _counter without calling setState(), then the build method would not be
    // called again, and so nothing would appear to happen.
    _counter++;
  });
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, i changed the variable <code>_counter</code> to be <em>nullable</em> and took off the initialization:</p>
<pre class=""lang-dart prettyprint-override""><code>int? _counter;

void _incrementCounter() {
  setState(() {
    _counter++;
  });
}
</code></pre>
<p>And as expected, i got the following error in the editor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The operator ‘+’ can’t be unconditionally invoked because the receiver can be 'null'</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Following <a href=""https://dart.dev/tools/diagnostic-messages#unchecked_use_of_nullable_value"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the documentation</a> i added the required checking:</p>
<pre class=""lang-dart prettyprint-override""><code>if (_counter!=null)
        _counter++;

</code></pre>
<p>but to my astonishment, the error kept on showing and suggesting</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Try making the call conditional (using '?' or adding a null check to the target ('!'))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>even though i explicitly am making <em>the call conditionally</em>... so what is wrong?</p>

<p>I saw that this has to do with Java 8 but in the IntelliJ instructions it says nothing about using Java 8. Is Java 8 always necessary or can codenameone run with Java 15, too?</p>
<p>EDIT:
I have now got it to open by simply copying the first line with the java command and removing the UseConcMarkSweepGC flag, then running it in terminal. But I am still not sure if that is &quot;the correct way&quot; to do it or if something could break along the way now.</p>

<p>For <code>n=500</code> in C++ we can run</p>
<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;array&gt;

std::array&lt;int, 2&gt; fib(unsigned n) {
    if (!n)
        return {1, 1};
    auto x = fib(n - 1);
    return {(x[0] + x[1]) % 997, (x[0] + 2 * x[1]) % 997};
}

int main() {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; fib(500)[0];
}
</code></pre>
<p>and in Python</p>
<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>def fib(n):
    if n==1:
        return (1, 2)
    x=fib(n-1)
    return ((x[0]+x[1]) % 997, (x[0]+2*x[1]) % 997)

if __name__=='__main__':
    print(fib(500)[0])
</code></pre>
<p>Both will find the answer 996 without issues. We are taking modulos to keep the output size reasonable and using pairs to avoid exponential branching.</p>
<p>For <code>n=5000</code>, the C++ code outputs 783, but Python will complain</p>
<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison
</code></pre>
<p>If we add a couple of lines</p>
<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>import sys

def fib(n):
    if n==1:
        return (1, 2)
    x=fib(n-1)
    return ((x[0]+x[1]) % 997, (x[0]+2*x[1]) % 997)

if __name__=='__main__':
    sys.setrecursionlimit(5000)
    print(fib(5000)[0])
</code></pre>
<p>then Python too will give the right answer.</p>
<p>For <code>n=50000</code> C++ finds the answer 151 within milliseconds while Python crashes (at least on my machine).</p>
<p>Why are recursive calls so much cheaper in C++? Can we somehow modify the Python compiler to make it more receptive to recursion?</p>
<p>Of course, one solution is to replace recursion with iteration. For Fibonacci numbers, this is easy to do. However, this will swap the initial and the terminal conditions, and the latter is tricky for many problems (e.g. alpha–beta pruning). So generally, this will require a lot of hard work on the part of the programmer.</p>
